            <h3>Vash The Stampede</h1>
                <h1>With 60 Billion Double-Dollar Bounty On His Head</h1>
                <p> Yeah, that’s me, the guy with the 60 billion double-dollar bounty on his head. But hold on,
                    don’t let that fool you! I’m not some heartless monster or a villain looking for trouble—far from
                    it! I’m just a simple man,
                    trying to live by my motto: love and peace! Sure, I might leave behind a little chaos, but it’s
                    never on purpose,
                    I swear! I mean, can’t a guy enjoy his donuts in peace without someone trying to shoot him?
                    Anyway, the whole 'Humanoid Typhoon' thing? Just a big misunderstanding… I’d rather help people than
                    hurt them. So, no matter what you’ve heard,
                    I’m really just a gun-toting goofball on a mission to spread kindness in a world that really needs
                    it!</p>

    <div id="about-page">
        <div class="about-item">
            <p>Vash the Stampede, also known as the "Humanoid Typhoon,"
                is the enigmatic protagonist of Trigun. With a bounty
                of 60 billion double dollars on his head, Vash is feared
                across a desert-like planet for the chaos and destruction
                that seems to follow in his wake. Clad in a red trench coat,
                with spiky blonde hair and signature yellow-tinted glasses,
                he cuts the figure of a deadly gunslinger. However,
                this fearsome reputation is largely a misunderstanding.
                In truth, Vash is a pacifist who avoids violence and killing at all costs,
                preferring to solve conflicts through humor, wit, and empathy. His skill with a gun is unmatched,
                yet he always strives to incapacitate rather than kill, often putting his own life at risk to protect
                others.</p>

        <div class="about-item">
            <p>Beneath his cheerful, lighthearted demeanor,
                Vash carries the weight of a tragic past and a deep internal struggle.
                As an artificially created being with extraordinary powers,
                he grapples with the consequences of his existence and the destruction caused by his "brother,"
                Knives. This inner conflict between his idealistic belief in peace and the harsh,
                violent reality of the world forms the core of his character. Despite the dangers he faces and the
                misunderstandings about his true nature,
                Vash remains steadfast in his commitment to love, peace,
                and protecting humanity—making him one of the most iconic and morally complex characters in anime.</p>
